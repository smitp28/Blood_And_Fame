  - "Oh! Um... hello. I\u2019m not supposed to talk to people I don't know."
  - "But I can\u2019t find my dog, Biscuit. He got scared and ran off into the woods."
  - If you see a small, scruffy dog nearby... could you maybe bring him back?
  - "Really? Thank you! He\u2019s a bit shy with strangers at first, but he\u2019s
    very friendly once he knows you're nice!"
  - "Oh... okay. I\u2019ll keep calling for him myself then. I hope he isn't scared."
  - "Biscuit! You found him! See, I told you he\u2019d like you. Thank you so, so
    much!"
